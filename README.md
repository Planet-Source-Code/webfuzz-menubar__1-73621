### Description

Simple Menu Bar (Kinda like Deskmenu 96!) but configurable thru text files.

Works in Win 98, thru Win 7

I wrote this program just for me. I wanted something to replace Deskmenu 96!, and I wanted NO ICONS!! No Icons means program runs quicker, saves memory, and saves resources. Don't have to wait to retrieve the icon for every item.. A no frills, very fast, silly simple to understand program.

MenuBar doesn't have to be installed. Just copy to a directory and run.

I did add the Drag & Drop feature to make life a little easier. Start Drag & Drop mode, then drag MOST icons onto the menu button and click on save.

Coding was written so beginners could easily understand.
